# blog_angular2_play

This is a template for a blog application which uses Angular 2 at the front end, Play 2.5 at the back end, and holds state in a
postgresql 9.4 database. 

To use it make sure activator is installed and on the path. Create a postgresql database with the name blog and the credentials as
shown in conf/application.conf. A database dump with dummy data is included in dumpfile.sql.

This is an expansion of the basic template at https://github.com/degt/angular2-blog-example although it is expected to grow into a mature
blogging application over the coming weeks.

This will eventually provide the blogging engine for my own blog.
